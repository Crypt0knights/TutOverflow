### MATHEMATICS FOR PROGRAMMERS AND DATA SCIENCE ENTHUSIASTS

1. Calculus -  Extremely important for a lot of programming topics. Machine Learning, Artificial intelligence, Minimisation /Maximisation, etc.

2.  Linear Algebra - Matrices are key to solve a lot of problems. It is again a very general topic which every programmer should know

3.  Number Theory - This a useful topic if you are working with cryptography. It is also useful to understand the low level representations of data. Number Theory along with well    	known sequences is also important for competitive programming.

4.  Game Theory - Again a domain specific concept. You may never need it in your entire programming career but for it is useful for competitive programming and modelling several real - life problems.

5.  Probability & Estimation Theory - You have to know probability concept to be a good software engineers. Period.  There are tons of problems where we can only solve a problem with a certain accuracy. If you are working with Machine Learning, AI or Genetic Algorithms it is very very important. Some basic algorithms like Quick Sort has probability as it's pre-requisite

6.  Graph Theory - Graph is a huge domain in computer science and are used almost everywhere from databases to front-end. Trees and Graphs as commonly occurring patterns that you should be aware of.

7.  Coordinate Geometry - Working with maps ? Points ? Distance ? Coordinate geometry is very very important. Any location based service would essentially require knowledge of basic coordinate geometry.
